# PatternChromeDashboard

## General information
* You can find the Website here: https://jonas-wolber.shinyapps.io/PatternChromeDashboard/
* The PatternChromeDashboard uses R Shiny to show the prediction breakdown of the XGBoost model
* PatternChrome is a Bioinformatics tool for the prediction of gene expression using epigenetic data (five histone modification data)
* We intend to publish our scientific findings about PatternChrome soon. The algorithm was developed at the Medical Bioinformatics Institute GÃ¶ttingen


## Next steps
[] Add information about the cell line model
[] Display the most important patterns and provide information about it
[] Allow the user to upload ChIP-Seq files and get a RNA Seq prediction and a pattern breakdown

Stay tuned for more and have fun!
